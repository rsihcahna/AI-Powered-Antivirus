# System Architecture: AI-Powered Antivirus

## Overview
The antivirus system integrates artificial intelligence to detect and prevent malware in real-time across multiple platforms.

## Architecture Components

1. **Frontend (React + Vite)**
   - UI Dashboard for monitoring threats and activity.
   - Displays scan results, alerts, and system metrics.

2. **Backend (Python, Go, Rust)**
   - **Python**: Hosts the main logic, API, and AI model operations.
   - **Go**: Performs efficient network packet monitoring.
   - **Rust**: Conducts deep system-level scanning with safety and speed.

3. **Database (SQLite)**
   - Stores malware signatures, scan history, and detection metadata.

4. **AI Model**
   - Trained using labeled malware datasets.
   - Predicts malicious intent based on features extracted from files.

## Interaction Flow
Frontend ⇄ API Gateway ⇄ AI/Scan Engine ⇄ Database
