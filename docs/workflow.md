# Workflow: AI-Powered Antivirus

## 1. Initialization
- Services start: backend APIs, network and system scanners, and frontend UI.
- Database is connected and tables are verified.

## 2. File Monitoring
- Files are scanned using Rust engine and features are extracted.

## 3. Prediction
- Features are sent to the Python-based AI model.
- Model returns prediction: Malicious or Benign.

## 4. Signature Verification
- System checks file hash/signature against known malware database.

## 5. Network Monitoring
- Go module captures suspicious traffic patterns.

## 6. Alerts and Logging
- If malware is found, logs are created and alerts pushed to frontend dashboard.

## 7. Learning Loop
- Newly found samples are flagged for training to improve model performance.
